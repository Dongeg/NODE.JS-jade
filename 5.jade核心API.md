<h3>jade所有方法都有如下参数选项</h3>

filename:             string            Used in exceptions, and required for relative includes and extends

doctype:              string            If the doctype is not specified as part of the template, 
                                        you can specify it here. It is sometimes useful to get self-closing tags 
                                        and remove mirroring of boolean attributes.

pretty:               boolean | string  Adds whitespace to the resulting html to make it easier for a human to read 
                                         using ' ' as indentation. If a string is specified, 
                                         that will be used as indentation instead (e.g. '\t').
self:                 boolean            Use a self namespace to hold the locals (false by default)
debug:                boolean            If set to true, the tokens and function body is logged to stdout
compileDebug:         boolean            Set this to false to disable debugging instrumentation 
                                         (recommended in production). Set it to true to include the function source in 
                                         the compiled template for better error messages(sometimes useful in development).
cache:                boolean            If set to true, compiled functions are cached. filename must be set as the cache
                                         key.
compiler:             class              Override the default compiler
parser:               class              Override the default 
parserglobals:       Array.<string>      Add a list of global names to make accessible in templates
